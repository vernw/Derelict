    <result xml:space="preserve">An abhorrent hissing sound reverberates haphazardly throughout your body. A lingering chill eases into a familiar lukewarmth as the sound of air whistling out of a small hole ushers you to open your eyes. You catch a glimpse of frost clinging onto the military-grade glass panel in front of you slowly melting away. A display projected onto the glass flashes the word "Depressurizing" incessantly until the hissing dissipates.&#x000A;&#x000A;Two heavy clicks are heard, the panel in front of you begins to remove itself and provide you escape from your confinement. A third clunk freezes the hatch in its tracks, leaving a small gap between the mechanism's seams.  You can see steel floor panels through the gap connecting you to the environment outside. As feeling is returned rightfully to your limbs, you forcefully kick the hatch open, sending the door into the wall opposite you. Surprised at how easy it was to break out of your capsule, you ponder the amount of time that has passed.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you step out of your hold, you notice the dim illumination of the room. Albeit the room is nigh pitch black, you make out the painted "Cryostasis Block D" on the large steel grey wall ahead.&#x000A;&#x000A;Derelict&#x000A;A dark mystery by Vern &amp; Mark&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 150605 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Cryostasis Hold&#x000A;The Cryostasis Hold is designed for keeping passengers from aging (or getting bored) during long space flights.  Generally, the crew can also go into periods of Cryostasis allowing the AI to handle the day to day management of the ship, however, as this was also a research voyage, there are only enough pods for the passengers.  You look around at the names labling the various pods, but none of them seem familiar, even the one labling the pod you stepped out of.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Commons is fore of here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You're finally awake!  Sorry for the delay, but I thought I'd offer you a friendly warning before you step through that door.  You see... there's been, well, a sort of accident.  Everyone kind of, well.  Died.  All of them.  Except you!  You're still alive so that's a plus, right?  I can't tell you how they died though, sorry to say.  This is a research voyage and that knowledge is above your security clearance at the moment.  Anyway, I was just going to leave you frozen for the rest of the journey, but... there are just SO many bodies.  It's getting rather irritating looking at them.  They're quite the eyesore, all pale and clammy looking.  Blech!  I just need someone with a body themself to help clean up the lifeless ones.  I don't have arms afterall!  You have a strange look on your face... OH! Right.  The memory thing.  I should introduce myself.  I'm Herman, the ship's AI.  Anyway, since you're not doing anything, could you please dispose of the corpses in the next room?  They're not bloody or anything, they just need to be taken down to the incinerator in the engineering department on floor 3.  There's also a hover cart that should help you *dispose of the bodies* though you might need a few trips."&#x000A;&#x000A;The door panel in front of you turns green.  The intercom buzzes again.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh! I almost forgot.  There's an enginnering powersuit in the locker next to your pod.  It should help you do the heavy lifting."&#x000A;&#x000A;You begin to shiver again.  Now that the shock of death has worn off you've realized you're only garbed in something like a hospital gown.  You return to the pod and notice the locker next to it for the first time.  You place your thumb on the scanner, and it buzzes back go life.  The screen turns red and flashes, rejecting your input.  You try again, but no luck.  You try your index finger instead.  The device seems to hesitate, flashing a rainbow of colors, settling on green, and buzzing open.  You find an engineer's power suit inside, and you put it on.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Once there you take a quick look around before noticing the Incinerator in the corner.  You walk up to it and tilt the hover cart towards it's entrance.  You feel a few butterflies in your stomach, but your unease isn't enough for you to question your actions.  The flames quickly engulf the bodies, as the device reacts to the size of the load.  Almost immediately your nostrils are assaulted by a uniquely disturbing scent.  The bodies are not so that they smell of rot, but rather smell like roasted meat.  You now regret possessing the knowledge that cooked human flesh can seem rather appetizing.  You shake yourself out of your stupor, and return to the Commons to gather up the next batch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
